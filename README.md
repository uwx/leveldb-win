# Automated LevelDB builds for Windows (x86 and x64)

This repository hosts Windows builds of LevelDB as a static or dynamic library. See the [releases](https://github.com/uwx/leveldb-win/releases) page for downloads.

These builds are automatically uploaded, usually a few minutes after commits are made to the upstream [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) repo.
